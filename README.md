# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/B0B36JUL-FinalProjects-2022/Projekt_mlynatom/blob/main/LICENSE)

Projekt_mlynatom package provides data processing of Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster data and prediction of survival
by ridge logistic regression and neural networks.

## Installation

The package is not available from official repositories and can be installed with the following command.
```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> add https://github.com/B0B36JUL-FinalProjects-2022/Projekt_mlynatom
```

## Description of data from kaggle.com
### Data Dictionary
| Variable | Definition	| Key |
| -------- | ---------- | --- |
| survival | Survival | 0 = No, 1 = Yes |
| pclass | Ticket class	| 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd |
| sex | Sex ||	
| Age | Age in years ||
| sibsp	| # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic ||
| parch	| # of parents / children aboard the Titanic ||
| ticket | Ticket number ||
| fare	| Passenger fare ||
| cabin	| Cabin number ||
| embarked | Port of Embarkation | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |
### Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

## Usage
This package focuses on two main parts: Data processing and prediction of survival.
### Data processing
In this part (mainly in src/data_preparation.jl) are data processing functions provided.
Main focus is on processing categorical values, filling missing values and creating new
data from other.

### Prediction of survival

In this part are implemented 2 options. First is ridge logistic regression and second are neural networks.
